Yea, long time see ya. Như tiêu đề, sau khi đổi chuyển ngành xong, mọi thứ khá là mess up. I'm a senior of Control Automation Engineering, but I am passion on Telecommunication. How about
Control Automation Engineering I know? Nothing. I spent a lot of time on researching protocol, computer network and DevOps. That is a point I want to share you, I got myself into a mess when I find an internship. I don't what know I like, what I am going to do. At this time, I has think too much, I wish I have a time. The golden rule you need to remember is your career path was identified before you begin it. The time is not waiting for you. Yeah like someone said: "Hãy nghĩ về bắt đầu như nghĩ về kết quả"
