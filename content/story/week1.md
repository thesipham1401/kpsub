Hello every, It's me again. I had a long study week at my university. It was fun to met my classmate  'cause I have two month on my room. This was great to see my teachers in a real life, because I was boring with sit in front the screen all day to watch livestream and self-study. At that time, I proposed myself to self-study Javascript, HTML, CSS and PHP. However, the result is really bad, I played game the whole time.

Let's talk some subject I'm learning at university, Marketing and PoC are not my favorite subjects, but I found my motivation on other skills, some guys too good at english and presentation skills.

Now turn to some specialized subjects, Network Communication quite familiar to me, because I learned CCNA before, but my teacher different on his's teaching way. Instead of explaning like a normal way, he ask our class by many quetions why. This leads me more interested, because I know the answers of the questions which nobody ask. The last subject is Wireless Communicaiton of my instructor, I prepared the knowledge before I came to class, but I faced surprise about lack of knowledge of some subject I can't enroll.

And I made a big mistake to believe someone who don't deserve, as a result, it's quite hurt and bitter.
